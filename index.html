        Define Software Engineering: Software engineering is the branch of
        computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and
        maintenance of software applications
      </p>
      <p>
        What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional
        programming? Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):Software
        Engineering: Software engineering is a disciplined and systematic
        approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software. It
        involves applying engineering principles to software development in
        order to create reliable, efficient, and scalable software systems.
        Software engineering covers the entire lifecycle of software, including
        requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and
        maintenance.(1) Traditional programming focuses on writing code to solve
        specific problems, while software engineering encompasses a broader
        scope, including project management, quality assurance, and maintenance.
        (2) Software engineering often involves collaboration among large teams
        with specialized roles (e.g., developers, testers, project managers).
        Traditional programming can be a solo activity or involve smaller, less
        structured teams.

        (1) Planning: Identify the scope and objectives of the project, Conduct
        feasibility studies and allocate resources,Develop a project plan and
        timeline. (2) Requirements Analysis:Gather and document detailed user
        and system requirements. Conduct requirements validation to ensure
        clarity and completeness.(3)Design: Create architectural designs and
        detailed system specifications, Develop models and diagrams (e.g., UML)
        to represent system components and interactions. (4) Implementation
        (Coding): Translate design documents into executable code, Follow coding
        standards and best practices to ensure code quality.

        Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software
        development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might
        each be preferred? Requirements Engineering: Agile: Suitable for
        projects with evolving requirements, where flexibility and rapid
        delivery are crucial (e.g., software startups, web and mobile app
        development). Waterfall: Suitable for projects with well-defined
        requirements and low likelihood of changes (e.g., government projects,
        construction projects).
      </p>
      <p>
        Requirements Engineering: Requirements engineering is the process of
        defining, documenting, and maintaining the requirements for a software
        system. It involves identifying the needs of stakeholders and
        translating them into detailed specifications that can guide the
        development process. Process: Elicitation: Gather requirements from
        stakeholders through interviews, surveys, workshops, and observations.
        Analysis: Analyze and prioritize requirements to ensure they are clear,
        complete, and feasible. Specification: Document the requirements in a
        formal requirements specification document. Validation: Validate the
        requirements with stakeholders to ensure they accurately reflect their
        needs and expectations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Modularity: Modularity is the design principle of breaking down a
        software system into smaller, manageable, and independent modules or
        components. Each module performs a specific function and can be
        developed, tested, and maintained independently.
      </p>
      <p>
        importance of testing: Quality Assurance: Ensures that the software
        meets the required quality standards and functions correctly. Risk
        Mitigation: Identifies and addresses defects and issues early, reducing
        the risk of failures in production. User Satisfaction: Ensures that the
        software meets user expectations and requirements. Cost Savings:
        Detecting and fixing issues early in the development process is more
        cost-effective than addressing them after deployment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Version Control Systems (VCS): Version control systems are tools that
        help manage changes to source code and other project files over time.
        They allow multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously,
        track changes, and revert to previous versions if needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Role of a Software Project Manager: A software project manager is
        responsible for planning, executing, and closing software projects. They
        ensure that projects are completed on time, within budget, and to the
        specified quality standards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Software maintenance involves making updates and modifications to a
        software system after its initial deployment to correct issues, improve
        performance, or adapt to changes in the environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ethical Issues: Privacy: Ensuring the privacy and confidentiality of
        user data. Security: Developing secure software to protect against
        vulnerabilities and attacks. Intellectual Property: Respecting
        copyrights, patents, and licenses of software and other digital content.
        Bias and Fairness: Avoiding bias in algorithms and ensuring fairness in
        software systems. Transparency: Being transparent about how software
        works and how data is used. Professionalism: Maintaining honesty,
        integrity, and professionalism in all aspects of work.
